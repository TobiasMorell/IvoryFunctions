# IvoryFunctions
A hobby project, in which I attempt to replicate the workings of AzureFunctions in a more modular and configurable way.

**This is very much WIP**, and not something I'm continuously working on. I'm just doing this for fun and to learn more 
about AzureFunctions and MassTransit, and because I like the concept of AzureFunctions but dislike that it's 
vendor-locked to Azure-services.

The first goal of this project, going forward, is to reach a point, where this behaves similar to an out-of-the-box
Azure Functions project.
